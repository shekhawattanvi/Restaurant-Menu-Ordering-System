# Restaurant-Menu-Ordering-System

This project is a console-based restaurant menu and ordering system developed during the summer of 2025 using the C++ programming language, built and tested in Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

It demonstrates practical use of:

* Structures – for organizing customer and menu data

* File Handling – for reading menu items from external files (menu.txt)

* Modular Programming – by organizing code into reusable and readable functions

* Loops and Conditions – for menu-driven interaction

* Input/Output streams – for user-friendly terminal interaction
